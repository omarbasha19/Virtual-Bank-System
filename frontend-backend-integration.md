# Frontend-Backend Integration Complete

## Overview of Changes

The integration of the frontend with the WSO2 API Gateway backend has been completed. All HTML pages have been updated to use the enhanced API service that communicates with the backend microservices through the API Gateway.

## Key Integration Features

1. **Centralized API Communication**:
   - Created a robust `api-service.js` that handles all backend API calls
   - Implemented proper error handling for API calls
   - Added support for self-signed SSL certificates in development

2. **Authentication Flow**:
   - User login/registration with the UserService API
   - Session management with 8-hour expiration
   - Secure token storage and handling

3. **Data Management**:
   - Account creation and management via AccountService
   - Money transfers via TransactionService
   - Dashboard data aggregation via BFFService

4. **User Experience**:
   - Consistent error handling across all pages
   - Proper loading indicators during API calls
   - User-friendly validation and error messages

## Pages Updated

1. **Ejada Login Form.html** - User authentication entry point
2. **signup.html** - New user registration form
3. **Account Details Page.html** - Dashboard showing accounts and transactions
4. **Create Account Page.html** - Interface for creating new bank accounts
5. **Ejada Transfer Page.html** - Money transfer functionality
6. **Transfer Confirmation Page.html** - Receipt after successful transfers

## Development Setup

For development, please refer to the `frontend-setup.md` file which contains instructions for:
- Setting up the development environment
- Handling the self-signed SSL certificate
- Running the frontend with the backend API Gateway

## Testing

To test the integration:

1. Start the backend services (refer to the main README.md)
2. Run the WSO2 API Gateway
3. Open the frontend application (starting with `Ejada Login Form.html`)
4. Register a new account or use default credentials
5. Navigate through the application to test different features

## API Gateway Configuration

- Base URL: `https://localhost:8243/vbank/1.0.0`
- Authentication: Bearer token with API key
- CORS: Enabled for local development

### Handling Self-Signed SSL Certificate

Since the API Gateway uses a self-signed SSL certificate, you need to manually accept it in your browser:

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to:
   ```
   https://localhost:8243/vbank/1.0.0
   ```
2. You'll see a security warning. Click "Advanced" and then "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)"
   (The exact wording may vary depending on your browser)
3. Once you've accepted the certificate, return to the application and refresh

**Note:** You may need to repeat this process if:
- You clear your browser cache
- You use a different browser
- The certificate expires or is changed

## Next Steps

- Set up automated testing for the frontend-backend integration
- Implement advanced features like account statements and notifications
- Enhance security with more robust authentication mechanisms
- Deploy the application to a production environment
